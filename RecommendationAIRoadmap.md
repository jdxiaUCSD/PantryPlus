# 7-Day Recipe Recommendation System Roadmap

## Overview
Build a complete recipe recommendation system from scratch, learning core ML concepts through hands-on implementation.

## Daily Schedule & Learning Objectives

### Day 1: Foundation & Data Setup
**Learning Focus**: Data handling, embeddings basics, vector similarity
**Time**: 3-4 hours

**Concepts to Learn:**
- Text embeddings and semantic similarity
- Vector databases basics
- Recipe data structures
- Cosine similarity vs other distance metrics

**Checkpoint: Basic Recipe Search**
```python
# Build a simple semantic search that can:
# 1. Load recipe dataset (use Kaggle recipe dataset)
# 2. Generate embeddings for recipe descriptions
# 3. Find similar recipes given a text query
# 4. Return top 10 matches with similarity scores

# Expected output: "healthy chicken dinner" → relevant recipes
```

**Technical Stack:**
- `sentence-transformers` (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model)
- `pandas` for data handling
- `numpy` for vector operations
- `scikit-learn` for similarity metrics

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Recipe dataset loaded and cleaned
- [ ] Embeddings generated for all recipes
- [ ] Query → similar recipes working
- [ ] Basic evaluation of results quality

### Day 2: User Modeling & Preferences
**Learning Focus**: User representation, preference learning, feature engineering
**Time**: 4-5 hours

**Concepts to Learn:**
- User profile vectors
- Implicit vs explicit feedback
- Feature engineering for preferences
- Cold start problem basics

**Checkpoint: User-Aware Search**
```python
# Extend Day 1 system with user preferences:
# 1. Model user dietary restrictions (vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.)
# 2. Track user cuisine preferences
# 3. Weight recipe recommendations by user profile
# 4. Handle new users with default preferences

# Expected output: Same query but different results per user
```

**User Profile Components:**
- Dietary restrictions (boolean flags)
- Cuisine preferences (weighted scores)
- Cooking time constraints
- Difficulty level preference
- Nutritional goals (high protein, low carb, etc.)

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] User profile data structure defined
- [ ] Preference weighting algorithm implemented

- User-based vs item-based collaborative filtering
- Sparse matrix handling

**Checkpoint: Collaborative Recommendations**
```python
# Build collaborative filtering component:
# 1. Create user-recipe interaction matrix
# 2. Implement basic matrix factorization
# 3. Generate "users like you also liked" recommendations
# 4. Combine with content-based filtering

# Expected output: Recommendations based on similar users' preferences
```

**Implementation Approach:**
- Use implicit feedback (views, saves, cooking attempts)
- Handle sparsity with matrix factorization
- Implement both user-based and item-based CF
- Create hybrid scoring system

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] User-item matrix created and populated
- [ ] Matrix factorization working

**Learning Focus**: Learning to rank, personalization algorithms, feature importance
**Time**: 4-5 hours

**Concepts to Learn:**

- Diversity in recommendations

**Checkpoint: Smart Ranking System**
```python
# Build sophisticated ranking:
# 1. Multiple ranking features (relevance, popularity, freshness)
# 2. Personalized ranking weights per user
# 3. Diversity injection (avoid too similar recipes)
# 4. Context-aware ranking (time of day, season)

# Expected output: Contextually relevant, diverse recommendations
```

**Ranking Features:**
- Semantic similarity score
- User preference match
- Recipe popularity/rating
- Seasonal relevance
- Cooking time match

**Checkpoint: Evaluation & Performance System**
```python
# Build comprehensive evaluation:
# 1. Implement multiple evaluation metrics
# 2. Create A/B testing framework
# 3. Optimize for sub-second response times
# 4. Build performance monitoring dashboard

# Expected output: Measurable system quality with fast responses
```

**Evaluation Metrics:**
